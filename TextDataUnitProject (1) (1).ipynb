    "\r\n",
    "This code performs an experimental evaluation of classifiers on textual data with various preprocessing configurations. Below is a summary of the process:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation (`prepare_data`)**:\r\n",
    "   - Loads and filters the dataset based on specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and quality thresholds.\r\n",
    "   - Filters out entries that don't meet minimum agreement and label difference requirements.\r\n",
    "   - Returns the text data (corpus) and corresponding labels.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Classification (`run_classification`)**:\r\n",
    "   - Transforms text data into numeric features using `CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer`.\r\n",
    "   - Splits data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.\r\n",
    "   - Trains a specified classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, MLP, Logistic Regression) on the training set.\r\n",
    "   - Tests the classifier on the test set and calculates evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Configuration Evaluation (`evaluate_configurations`)**:\r\n",
    "   - Runs multiple combinations of:\r\n",
    "     - **Vectorizers**: Count or TF-IDF.\r\n",
    "     - **N-gram ranges**: Unigrams, bigrams, or both.\r\n",
    "     - **Classifiers**: Multinomial Naive Bayes, MLP, Logistic Regression.\r\n",
    "   - Collects performance metrics for each configuration into a results table.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Highlight Best Metrics**:\r\n",
    "   - Identifies and bolds the best precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy values across all configurations.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Final Results**:\r\n",
    "   - Outputs a summary table of performance metrics for all configurations, making it easy to identify the best combination of vectorizer, n-grams, and classifier.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This code is designed for analyzing the performance of classifiers on SDG-labeled textual data and determining the optimal preprocessing and classification setup.\r\n"

    "1. **Best Overall Performance**: \n",
    "   - The combination of **Count Vectorizer** with **(1, 2) n-grams** and **Logistic Regression** achieved the highest scores across all metrics, with **Precision: 0.87, Recall: 0.87, F1-Score: 0.87, Accuracy: 0.87**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top TF-IDF Performance**:\n",
    "   - The best-performing configuration for TF-IDF was **(1, 1) n-grams** with **Logistic Regression**, achieving an **Accuracy of 0.87** and an **F1-Score of 0.86**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - Performed well with **Count Vectorizer (1, 1) n-grams**, achieving **Precision: 0.87, Recall: 0.87, F1-Score: 0.87, Accuracy: 0.87**.\n",
    "   - Its performance declined when applied with TF-IDF or higher-order n-grams.\n",

    "4. **MLP Classifier**:\n",
    "   - Achieved competitive results across most configurations but did not outperform Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes in any specific setting.\n",

    "5. **Impact of Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - The use of **Count Vectorizer** consistently outperformed TF-IDF for both unigram and combined unigram + bigram settings.\n",

    "3. **Classify New Text**:\r\n",

    "Galapagos Giant Tortoise Feeding Ecology\n",
    "Having discovered some of the mechanisms governing migration and other movements, we wanted to place our new knowledge into a wider ecological and conservation context. We knew that food availability influenced tortoise migrations, but we had little data on tortoise diets. Previous studies had been conducted in the 1980s before the explosion of introduced species on Santa Cruz Island.\n",
    "\n",
    "We spent several hundred hours observing tortoises and recording all feeding activity, noting the plant species eaten and other details such as bites per minute. We also studied how plant communities change along the elevation gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tortoises eat at least 96 different plant species. Young mature leaves are preferred, and fruit also makes up a large part of the diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Galapagos tortoises consume many plant species that were introduced to Galapagos by people often preferring these over native and endemic plant species. Many of these species were brought to Galapagos as food sources for people and livestock and are highly nutritious so it is not surprising that tortoises feed on them. We found that the physical condition of tortoises may even be improved when feeding on plant species introduced to Galapagos by people.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unfortunate consequence of feeding heavily on fruits from non-native plant species introduced to Galapagos, such as guava, is that as tortoises eat the fruit, they are also ingesting the seeds they contain. We found that an average pile of tortoise poo contains several hundred seeds of the highly invasive guava tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also found that it might take two to three weeks for a seed to pass through a tortoise’s digestive tract and during this time, a migrating tortoise may travel several kilometers.  For this reason, tortoises are capable of dispersing huge numbers of seeds over large distances.  This accelerates the spread of these species, which can be highly invasive and destructive to native Galapagos plant communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, tortoises are also dispersing the seeds of many native species and potentially maintaining them on the islands. Tortoises can genuinely be called the “Gardeners of the Galapagos.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This story is written up more fully in the following journal articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dominance of Introduced Plant Species in the Diets of Migratory Galapagos Tortoises Increases with Elevation on a Human‐Occupied Island\n",
    "Seed dispersal by Galápagos tortoises\n",
    "Digesta retention time in the Galápagos tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra)\n",
    "Plant species dispersed by Galapagos tortoises surf the wave of habitat suitability under anthropogenic climate change\n",
    "Galapagos Giant Tortoises and Human Interactions\n",
    "As Galapagos develops economically and the human population rises, it will be increasingly important to understand the dynamics of tortoise-human interactions.\n",

    "Like migratory species all over the world, long distance migration by Galapagos tortoises means that many tortoises leave the protective security of the Galapagos National Park and enter private farmland in the highlands of Santa Cruz and other inhabited islands. This has the potential to lead to challenges both for farmers and for tortoises – several giant tortoises can destroy a field of newly planted maize, for example. On the other hand, the presence of tortoises is compatible with cattle farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the private lands of Galapagos are dedicated to different uses, from arable agriculture, to livestock production, to tourism and urban development, all of which have different implications for tortoise conservation and the relationship between tortoise and people. As Galapagos develops economically and the human population rises, it will be increasingly important to understand the dynamics of tortoise-human interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional research started in 2017 involves in-depth studies within farmlands to better understand how tortoise movements and behavior might depend on land use and habitat fragmentation, and which strategies could be implemented together with land owners and stakeholders to solve these potential conflicts and their consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have integrated research on this issue into the Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Program. First, a brief stakeholder workshop was initiated in 2018 to bring private landowners, researchers, and members of the Galapagos National Park Directorate and local institutions together to generate a constructive dialogue to share experiences and discuss strategies and solutions to potential conflicts between people and tortoises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attitudes toward tortoises were almost exclusively positive or benign, with landowners recognizing the importance of tortoises to the entire economy of Galapagos, and the non-trivial recognition that the “tortoises were here first.” However, if tortoises are perceived to limit rather than enhance economic opportunity, this situation could change.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a follow-up to this work, we facilitated a study on tortoise ecology in private lands conducted by PhD student Kyana Pike. The study involved analysis of how tortoise ranging and behavior in private lands are influenced by land use type and human infrastructure such as roads, fences, and natural and artificial ponds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Positioning System (GPS)-tagged tortoises spend an average of 150 days per year in private lands, and a tortoise uses an average of four farms, up to a maximum of 24 different farms. Use of multiple farms under multiple different land uses by a single tortoise indicates that finding shared solutions to tortoise conservation and conflict mitigation on Santa Cruz island will require cooperation across the agricultural zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to our expectations, fences in their current configuration seem to present few serious barriers to tortoise movements. Most fences are in a poor state of repair, however even fences designed to keep tortoises out of crop areas are relatively porous.\n",
    "\n",
    "This important research is in its early days and we will be reporting on outputs in detail in the future. Initial scientific publications on this work are published in the following journal articles:\n",

    "Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked worldwide – including right here in the United States. It can happen in any community and victims can be any age, race, gender, or nationality. Traffickers might use the following methods to lure victims into trafficking situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Violence\n",
    "Manipulation\n",
    "False promises of well-paying jobs\n",
    "Romantic relationships \n",
    "Language barriers, fear of their traffickers, and/or fear of law enforcement frequently keep victims from seeking help, making human trafficking a hidden crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffickers look for people who are easy targets for a variety of reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological or emotional vulnerability\n",
    "Economic hardship\n",
    "Lack of a social safety net\n",
    "Natural disasters\n",
    "Political instability\n",
    "The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly public settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many myths and misconceptions exist. Recognizing key indicators of human trafficking is the first step in identifying victims and can help save a life. Not all indicators listed are present in every human trafficking situation, and the presence or absence of any of the indicators is not necessarily proof of human trafficking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safety of the public as well as the victim is important. Do not attempt to confront a suspected trafficker directly or alert a victim to any suspicions. It is up to law enforcement to investigate suspected cases of human trafficking.\n",

    "Today, a confluence of factors is prompting America to change the way it thinks about age and work. The economic downturn, shifting perceptions of retirement, increased workplace flexibility, and the aging of the \"baby boom\" generation are all contributing to people working longer. Many of these capable, experienced mature workers develop disabilities as they age, or existing disabilities may become more significant. To retain the talents of these valuable, skilled workers, employers can implement a variety of workplace practices, many of which benefit all workers and make good business sense. The following resources provide more information about the topic of older workers:\n",

    "Postsecondary education is increasingly important for older job seekers' reemployment. Yet, they may face potential challenges in accessing and completing education and training due to their greater likelihood of having acquired age-related disabilities. The following three briefs provide new research data and findings on older students and dislocated workers researched by the NTAR Leadership Center. Existing data, such as that from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, does not track the numbers of dislocated workers enrolled at community colleges; and nearly three-quarters of community colleges reported very few students with disabilities enrolled (less than three percent of their student population). Moreover, among older students, unidentified disabilities are not documented, which provides challenges for community colleges to document their statistics on older students with disabilities.\n",

    "Breaking the age code art\n",
    "Age is just a number\n",
    "Becca Levy, BA '87\n",
    "Scientist/author Becca Levy, BA ’87, is a professor of both epidemiology and psychology at Yale. (Image courtesy of Levy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "American author and activist Betty Friedan once observed: “Aging is not ‘lost youth’ but a new stage of opportunity and strength.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who share her optimism may find the pathway to longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientist Becca Levy, BA ’87, a leading expert on the psychology of successful aging, says taking an upbeat attitude toward aging can not only improve your physical and mental health as you grow older ― but also may add nearly eight years to your lifespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "She explains how our positive and negative age beliefs shape our behaviors, health, and, ultimately, our longevity in her new book Breaking the Age Code (William Morrow; April 12, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Levy also reveals that some health issues commonly associated with old age ― hearing loss, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease ― are the products of negative stereotypes and prejudices absorbed from our social surroundings. All too often, these fatalistic attitudes about the inevitability of declining health in later life become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Age beliefs impact our health in ways big and small,” says Levy, who became interested in psychology as a U-M undergraduate. She completed her graduate work at Harvard, and is now a professor of epidemiology and of psychology at Yale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“People who have more-positive beliefs tend to show benefits in health outcomes and healing compared to those who hold more-negative ones,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprise!\n",
    "Over the past 20 years, Levy has conducted groundbreaking studies on different health conditions affected by attitudes toward aging. Her results show some surprising results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognition ― People who stress positive age beliefs enjoy better memory performance.\n",
    "Physical health ― Patients with favorable attitudes about aging are more likely to recover from severe disability.\n",
    "Mental health ― Individuals who see aging as a positive experience have lower stress levels.\n",
    "Longevity ― Younger people who adopt a positive outlook on aging live an average of 7.5 years longer.\n",
    "While Levy’s research underscores the value of celebrating our advancing years as a time for creativity, exploration, and accomplishment, today’s reality is often quite different. All too frequently, personal views, cultural stereotypes, and institutional biases about aging are tilted in a negative direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In American society, old age is presented as something to be feared and avoided. Aging individuals are portrayed as fragile, forgetful, and a burden on society. The elderly are marginalized, ignored, and “put out to pasture.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Levy describes this pervasive ageism in the U.S. and other countries as the “Silent Epidemic” because it operates, undetected, in so many different realms ― social media, advertising, pop culture, Hollywood, and health care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ageism as big business\n",
    "Try the ABC Method to Bolster Positive Age Beliefs\n",
    "Awareness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jot down five words or phrases that come to mind when you think of an older person.\n",
    "Create a portfolio of positive older role models you admire.\n",
    "Notice age beliefs in the media.\n",
    "Think about ways to increase your intergenerational contacts and interactions.\n",
    "Blame-shifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the real cause of unpleasant events or challenges, such as momentary forgetfulness.\n",
    "Name the company or institution that benefits from negative age stereotypes.\n",
    "Identify ageism when older workers are targeted.\n",
    "Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Present accurate information to debunk negative age stereotypes.\n",
    "Get involved in politics.\n",
    "Confront ageism and negative age images in print, television, social media, and advertising.\n",
    "During America’s early history, views of aging were generally positive. However, in the mid-1800s, this positivity began to wane, giving way to less-favorable age beliefs that have taken hold over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The increase in negativity is due in part to the rise of advertisement and the growth of the antiaging industry,” says Levy, who has studied American age beliefs in written language spanning the past two centuries. “Companies have made a lot of money promoting negative images of aging as a way to sell their anti-aging products.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The research firm Statista projects the global anti-aging market will generate more than $67 billion in 2022 by peddling pills, creams, tinctures, elixirs, hormonal supplements, and procedures that falsely claim to halt or even reverse aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “medical disability” complex\n",
    "Another source of ageism has been the increased “medicalization” of aging, Levy says.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Advertisements typically present images of older people as patients and recipients of medical care,” she says. “These ads are not balanced by images showing the heterogeneity of older adults who come from diverse backgrounds and are engaged in different activities, such as work, volunteering, sports, and recreation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Television, movies, and social media have amplified misbeliefs about aging. Ageism has become “click bait” on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Agelining has relegated elderly residents to age-segregated senior housing where they are, in effect, “quarantined” from society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Costly mistake\n",
    "Ageism in the workplace has cost many senior workers with years of valuable experience in their jobs, livelihoods, and feelings of self-worth. Two-thirds of workers in America said they have witnessed or personally experienced age discrimination in their place of work, according to an AARP survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Western medicine relies heavily on negative age stereotypes, with their narrative of inevitable decline, because it’s profitable, according to Levy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levy teamed up with an economist and statistician to put a price tag on the health costs resulting from ageism. They found it totaled $63 billion per year in the U.S., more than the cost of morbid obesity.“The multibillion-dollar ‘medical disability complex’ is based on expensive procedures, devices, and pharmaceutical drugs, which are more profitable than prevention efforts,” she says. “When ageism is ignored, doctors are apt to dismiss treatable conditions, such as back pain or depression, as standard features of old age.”\n",
    "This view of aging as a pathology can result in the undertreatment of elderly patients, she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levy teamed up with an economist and statistician to put a price tag on the health costs resulting from ageism. They found it totaled $63 billion per year in the U.S.,  more than the cost of morbid obesity, one of America’s most expensive chronic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The World Health Organization has called ageism the most prevalent and socially acceptable form of prejudice and discrimination today,” says Levy, who has testified before the U.S. Senate on the adverse effects of ageism. She also has contributed to briefs submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in age-discrimination cases and has participated in United Nations discussions of ageism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dislodging the stereotypes\n",
    "Despite the entrenched negative age stereotypes that permeate American society, Levy is convinced they can be dislodged and replaced by more-favorable views of aging and older people.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The most important takeaway from my research is that we know age beliefs are malleable,” Levy says. “We can increase our awareness of them, challenge some negative ones, and strengthen some positive ones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She demonstrated in one lab study that exposing older participants to subliminal positive messages about aging improved their physical function, including walking and balance. Another study showed that positive age beliefs lowered stress and helped at-risk people ward off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Igniting an age liberation movement\n",
    "Breaking the age code bookcover\n",
    "(William Morrow, April 2022.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time has come to shift from an age-declining to an age-thriving mindset, according to Levy, who presents a blueprint for overcoming structural ageism in her book.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think we are getting closer to a tipping point where an age liberation movement will take hold,” she says. “Growing numbers of people are becoming aware and angry about ageism.”\n",
    "\n",
    "National organizations, such as the American Psychological Association, the Gerontological Society of America, and HelpAge International, have begun issuing urgent warnings about the hazards of ageism. The Gray Panthers in New York City continue to confront age stereotypes and discrimination head-on. In addition, the World Health Organization recently launched its Campaign to Combat Ageism, which 194 countries have endorsed. Levy is serving as a scientific adviser to the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, until the groundswell of opposition to structural ageism in our social and policy institutions gains traction, ordinary people will need tools to navigate, question, and challenge negative stereotypes and attitudes on aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levy has developed an “ABC Method” that individuals can use to harness the power of their own positive age beliefs to improve their health. This approach consists of three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing Awareness of negative age beliefs within and around us\n",
    "Placing Blame on ageism and its societal sources\n",
    "Challenging negative age beliefs\n",
    "“As individuals acquire a greater sense of their value as older persons, they are more likely to participate in an age liberation movement,” Levy says. “The movement, in turn, is bound to further increase their sense of value as older persons. This cultural redefinition will contribute to a virtuous cycle.”\n",

    "Good article. It’s interesting, however, that the University of Michigan itself is very quick to treat patients differentially based solely on age. Patients over a certain age are quickly transported out of UM to a geriatric floor of St Joe’s with what I have observed as a lower level of care. The attitude of staff, especially younger staff, can be very ageist. I hope individuals in the UM system review this article.\n",

    "### Explanation for Misclassification (Predicted SDG: 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model predicted SDG 8 which is \"Decent Work and Economic Growth\". Although the pasted article does have some mention of these things, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) or SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) would have been better matches. Some of the reasons for this misclassification could have been becasue of:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary Mismatch**:\r\n",
    "   - The input text might use terms or phrases not strongly represented in the training data for SDG 8.\r\n",
    "   - For example, phrases like \"ageism\" or \"positive aging\" might not have been present in the SDG 8 examples during training.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Ambiguity in Content**:\r\n",
    "   - The text discusses broader societal topics (e.g., aging, public health, and discrimination) that could overlap with other SDGs, such as SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) or SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Training Data Imbalance**:\r\n",
    "   - If the training data includes a disproportionately small number of SDG 8 examples, the classifier might not accurately capture the nuances of thisra4 Networks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **N-Gram and Frequency Thresholds**:\r\n",
    "   - The current configuration uses n-grams `(1, 2)` and a `min_df=10`. This setup might filter out specific terms or combinations that are unique to SDG 8, reducing the model's ability to d5stinguish it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Human Bias in Text**:\r\n",
    "   - The text focuses on societal and psychological aspects rather than direct economic indicators (e.g., employment, labor policies), which are typically associated with SDG 8 (Decent Work and  well to diverse content.\r\n"
